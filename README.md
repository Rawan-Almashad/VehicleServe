Vehicle Service System 

📌 Overview

This project is a vehicle service system designed to connect customers with service providers.

Customers can request services for their vehicles.

Providers are listed based on their ratings, and customers can choose the provider they prefer.

Once selected, the provider receives a real-time notification with the customer’s request.

This system ensures a more reliable and efficient way for customers to find trusted providers, while providers can grow their reputation through ratings.

🛠️ Technologies Used

ASP.NET Core Web API – backend application logic

Entity Framework Core + SQL Server – database design and management

ASP.NET Identity + JWT – authentication, authorization, and role-based access
